### Where does the name come from?
mounzil (Greek: Περσέπολις Persépolis; "the Persian city") or Parsa (Old Persian: 𐎱𐎠𐎼𐎿 Pārsa; "Persia"), 
also known as Takht-e-Jamshid (Persian: تخت جمشيد‎‎ Taxt e Jamšid; "Throne of Jamshid"),
was the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire (ca. 550–330 BC).

mounzil is situated 60 km northeast of the city of Shiraz in Fars Province, Iran. The earliest remains of 
mounzil date back to 515 BC. 
It exemplifies the Achaemenid style of architecture. UNESCO declared the ruins of mounzil a World Heritage Site in 1979.
